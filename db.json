      "description": "Producing quality work is a priority for me. Thorough, precise and structured, strives to avoid errors in my work. My diligent attitude is the result of the importance I place on the point of view of others. I listen to ideas, suggestions and comments. It is therefore easy to work with me, to give space to others, to lend my support when needed and to complete tasks with thoroughness. In my relationships with others, I am humble and I do not impose my authority. I go straight to the point, avoid exaggerating. I adapt my speech to my audience, and is warm. In my style of work I structure my work, I plan and follow the procedures. I tackle one task at a time to avoid losing my concentration at work. I am meticulous, check my work and make few mistakes. In my emotional management I ensure that my decisions are reliable by evaluating the results. I am responsive, very energetic and have a sense of urgency. I radiate enthusiasm and see the bright side of things.",

      "description": "There are times when you have to know how to embark on projects, take your courage in both hands, your motivation and take the plunge. This is not obvious. But it's even less so when you have to make the decision to stop.\n\nKnowing how to say stop is however essential in order to protect yourself. There are projects where stubbornness costs much more energy than it brings us. In the end, the balance sheet is negative and it is our health that will suffer. Please note that the return on investment is not always financial. Much more can be found in satisfaction, accomplishment and recognition than in money. However, it has to be worth the effort.",
