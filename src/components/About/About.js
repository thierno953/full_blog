            Today, I am a junior web developer with a greater appetite for the
            frontend and also the backend. I pay a lot of attention to the value
            provided to end users. We don't make apps just to have fun, after
            all.
          </p>
          <p>I like sharing my skills and always eager to learn.</p>
