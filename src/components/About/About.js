      <p>
        I am Thierno junior web developer. Delighted to meet you. I create
        professional websites and application. I like to develop my ideas, work
        in team and I always try to bring my points of view, to find the
        solution and ready to learn new technologies. I'm quietly confident,
        naturally curious, and perpetually working to improve my chops one
        design issue at a time.
